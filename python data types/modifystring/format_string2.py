 # we can combine both strings and numbers by using 'format()' method .

 # the format() methos takes the passed arguements ,format them, and replace them in the string where the place holder is {}.


age = 26

txt = "My name is Nallapati, and I am {} "


print(txt.format(age))

# in above program where {} brackets are placed that is format method will apply,then if we add any variable in format method that value will apply on {} this brackets.
