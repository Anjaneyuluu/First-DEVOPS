# we can put a range from certain number in a string character by slicing syntax.

# specify the start index and the end index, seperated by colon,to return a part of the string.

b = "hello world"

print(b[1:10])


'''in above 'b' varibale the string value start with 0 index value so the first index in that string is "e" and the 10th index value is "l" so from 1to 10 value is given in output.'''
